    <p>Getting started with this free online chord progression generator is incredibly easy. All that you need is a chord progression, a starting note and the rest is to taste! Let’s go over the options really quick!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Chord progression</strong> This panel allows you to choose the progression of the chord progression. You can choose to keep the same chord throughout the entire progression or to change it up every bar. Some progressions will sound better than others!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Tonic / Root</strong> This panel is how you pick the key of the chord progression. The scale degrees which you selected in the first section will now have a context. For example, if you selected <strong>I as your first chord</strong> and you selected <strong>C as your tonic</strong>, then the first chord of the chord progression will be a C chord (C E G). </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Mode</strong> Picking a mode further defines the context of the previous two sections. Ionian or Aeolian are good places to start as those are essentially the major and minor scales, respectively, of the <strong>tonic / root</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Chord Progression Steps</strong> This panel defines how many steps are in each arpeggiated chord.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Chord Progression Type</strong> Simply put, a straight chord progression will go one direction twice while a looped chord progression will go one way and then back the opposite way, whether that be up or down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Chord Progression Style</strong> This section is the most fun! Here you can pick the movement of the chord progression. There are too many to explain each one in depth, but the first one will generate a linear, straight chord progression while the rest begin to get a little crazy!</p>
    </div>

      <p>The chord progression generator is a tool and an instrument focused on letting you easily create and perform new melodies that will definitely inspire you on current and future productions. The origin of this tool itself is inspired in part by the idea of a traditional arpeggiator: a feature found on some synthesizers which instantly creates looping sequences of notes in real time. </p>
      <p>We expanded on this fundamental concept and created a completely new musical instrument designed to give you the freedom to create inspiring melodies with nuance and distinction.</p>
      <p>Choose between basic triads, 7th chords, and even which key the chord progression is in. We have added options to expand from major and minor into the other common modes such as dorian, phrygian, and lydian!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <h5 class="c-card__title">Perform randomly generated melodies</h5>
      <p>The settings you pick during the setup will instantly create a unique looping sequence. You have the freedom to choose any amount of notes to play in the sequence as well as the order and of course the direction and pattern of the sequence. You can play with the tempo to get some cool ideas!</p>
      <p>When you’re ready to incorporate the result into your music you can instantly see the chords performed in the output box which are relative to the context of the scale degrees you created in the setup.</p>
    </div>
