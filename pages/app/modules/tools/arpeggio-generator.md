    <p>Getting started with this free online arpeggio generator is incredibly easy. All that you need is a chord progression, a starting note and the rest is to taste! Let’s go over the options really quick!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Chord progression</strong> This panel allows you to choose the progression of the arpeggio. You can choose to keep the same chord throughout the entire progression or to change it up every bar. Some progressions will sound better than others!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Tonic / Root</strong> This panel is how you pick the key of the arpeggio. The scale degrees which you selected in the first section will now have a context. For example, if you selected <strong>I as your first chord</strong> and you selected <strong>C as your tonic</strong>, then the first chord of the arpeggio will be a C chord (C E G). </p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Mode</strong> Picking a mode further defines the context of the previous two sections. Ionian or Aeolian are good places to start as those are essentially the major and minor scales, respectively, of the <strong>tonic / root</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Arpeggio Steps</strong> This panel defines how many steps are in each arpeggiated chord.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Arpeggio Type</strong> Simply put, a straight arpeggio will go one direction twice while a looped arpeggio will go one way and then back the opposite way, whether that be up or down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p><strong>Arpeggio Style</strong> This section is the most fun! Here you can pick the movement of the arpeggio. There are too many to explain each one in depth, but the first one will generate a linear, straight arpeggio while the rest begin to get a little crazy!</p>
