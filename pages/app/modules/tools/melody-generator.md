    <p>Getting started with this free online melody generator is incredibly easy. All that you need is a chord progression, a starting note and the rest is to taste! Let’s go over the options really quick!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Chord progression</strong> This panel allows you to choose the progression of the melody. You can choose to keep the same chord throughout the entire progression or to change it up every bar. Some progressions will sound better than others!</p>
    <p><strong>Tonic / Root</strong> This panel is how you pick the key of the melody. The scale degrees which you selected in the first section will now have a context. For example, if you selected <strong>I as your first chord</strong> and you selected <strong>C as your tonic</strong>, then the first chord of the melody will be a C chord (C E G). </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Mode</strong> Picking a mode further defines the context of the previous two sections. Ionian or Aeolian are good places to start as those are essentially the major and minor scales, respectively, of the <strong>tonic / root</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Melody Steps</strong> This panel defines how many steps are in each arpeggiated chord.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Melody Type</strong> Simply put, a straight melody will go one direction twice while a looped melody will go one way and then back the opposite way, whether that be up or down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-3">
    <p><strong>Melody Style</strong> This section is the most fun! Here you can pick the movement of the melody. There are too many to explain each one in depth, but the first one will generate a linear, straight melody while the rest begin to get a little crazy!</p>

    <p>The melody generator is a tool and an instrument focused on letting you easily create and perform new melodies that will definitely inspire you on current and future productions. The origin of this tool itself is inspired in part by the idea of a traditional arpeggiator: a feature found on some synthesizers which instantly creates looping sequences of notes in real time. </p>
    <p>We expanded on this fundamental concept and created a completely new musical instrument designed to give you the freedom to create inspiring melodies with nuance and distinction.</p>
