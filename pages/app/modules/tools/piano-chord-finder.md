    <h3>Using the Reverse Chord Namer</h3>
    <p>This free piano chord finder helps you identify chords by only supplying the note values. Simply enter the note names using the virtual piano keyboard to see which chord they form. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C E G = C</li>
      <li>A C E = Amin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This also helps you to identify intervals in this manner, as well. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C E = M3</li>
      <li>E G = P4</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h5>Using the Regular Piano Chord Namer</h5>
    <p>You can also use this tool the other way around. Simply use the text box at the bottom to enter a chord name to get the notes that make up this chord on the piano. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C = C E G</li>
      <li>Amin = A C E</li>
      <li>Bb dim = Bb Db E</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <h5>Using the Scale Identifier</h5>
    <p>You can also use this as a scale identifier. Simply enter a <strong>root</strong> followed by a <strong>mode</strong> (such as major, minor, ionian, etc). Try entering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C Major</li>
      <li>A Minor</li>
      <li>A Aeolian</li>
      <li>F Mixolydian</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="c-card__title">Why does learning piano chords matter?</h5>
    <p>When listening to your favorite songs or even when writing and producing your own music, you may sometimes be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of music theory knowledge required to fully understand the relationships among scales, chords, and all the rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="u-mb-medium">
    <p>Music is made up of individual notes, which complete chords, which finally build captivating chord progressions that lead the listener through the song. This can get incredibly confusing sometimes for composers and producers, especially when constructing chords they may not be entirely too familiar with. While this art comes naturally to some, there are tools out there like this chord and interval analyzer to help just about anyone create and identify simple and complex chords and scales. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how this chord and interval tool can help you.</p>
    <p>Simply click on the keys on the keyboard (which are labeled for your convenience) to build a chord. The chord namer will instantly tell you what chord is being played. </p>
