    <p>While this app explores more chords and scales than the average musician will ever use or need to know, it also serves as a reference to some absolutely crucial chords and scales that every musician and music producer should know. These beginner chords and scales exist in literally millions of songs. </p>
    <p>Because of the nature of music theory, these chords are not specific to any particular scale or key. Rather they are moveable and you can use them in any key once you learn the structure.</p>
