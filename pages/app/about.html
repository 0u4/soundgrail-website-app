SoundGrail was made from the heart. Moreover, SoundGrail was designed by musicians, for musicians.

As mentors and strategists, we saw such a significant number of artist visionaries attempting to utilize online social networking to develop their online presence. We saw a need to offer a service that would help aspiring artists promote their social media at a high level regardless of whether they have a full team of marketers or not.

Using SoundGrail you will have access to a plethora of music theory, music production, and live performance tools. Learn the same tricks the pros use to master their craft of music.

All of the tools you could possibly need are in the palm of your hand, such as the [chord progression generator tool]({{ site.url }}/chord-progression-generator) which creates beautiful chord progressions for you, or the [tap metronome]({{ site.url }}/metronome/) that you can use to quickly figure out the rhythm of a song. There are **many** more tools you can use completely **for free**. [Get started now]({{ site.url }})!
