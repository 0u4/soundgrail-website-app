The SoundGrail app has **multiple modules** that are each designed to help you with a specific task in the music-making process. We have modules such as a [metronome]({{ site.url }}}}/metronome/), a [chord generator tool]({{ site.url }}}}/chord-progression-generator/), and even a [reverse chord lookup tool]({{ site.url }}}}/reverse-chord-finder/).

Each module within the app has its own instructions. You can simply navigate to the desired function using the left sidebar. When the module loads, simply click the "Help" tab to learn exactly how to use each module.

If you still have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out! :)
